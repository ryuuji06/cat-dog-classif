# Simple Classification of Images Between Cat and Dog

In this test, I implemented a simple binary image classification system with a convolutional neural network (CNN), in order to classify an input image as `cat` or `dog`.

This code was inpired by the Keras tutorial [1], and the training is performed with the dataset [2]. The model used is a simplified ResNet, with separable convolutions [3].
